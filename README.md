# Raven

## A utility to map your business objects to your DTO objects.
Instead of creating separate factories to convert your business model to DTO, you can now
annotate your DTO class and use the ClassMapper's two static methods to convert from DTO to model and
vice versa.

## Version 1.0.0
Date: 18 April 2018
